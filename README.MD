# OdinRingMod
Add Souls-like leveling to your Valheim experience. Leveling your attributes will give bonuses to damage, health, carry weight, and more! Killing creatures will grant Eitr which can be spent at the Forbidden Shrine (a new piece that you can build using an Eikthyr trophy) to become stronger.

NOTE: This mod is still in the very early stages. It has been tested in an environment with various plugins and behaved but if you experience any issues with the plugin let me know and I'll try to get it fixed ASAP.
